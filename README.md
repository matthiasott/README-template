## Description

One to two paragraphs about the project: What is this project about? What does the project do? Why is it useful? What problem does it solve? Who is it for?

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites and Main Dependencies

* You need this

* Oh, and don't forget this

### Installation

How do you install the project and what do you need for it? Mention all dependencies that need to be installed first. Ideally, you also provide version numbers. (I’m looking at you, Node.js…)

Example:

```

## Usage

Instructions for how to configure, run, and use the project. For example, you can include the commands needed to install and start the development environment or any other useful and important commands. Screenshots can be included as well.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/yourname/yourproject/wiki)._

## Testing 

Any unit or integration tests people can run to assure that everything’s working as expected? Any frameworks or commands that are needed here? And are there any tests in your deployment pipeline that ensure that no errors make it into the live site?

Also include the commands needed to run any tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Deployment

Instructions for how to deploy the project to a production environment, including any server requirements and commands used. And, in case you are using a CI/CD pipeline, for example, how do any automated processes work? What are the most important branches? Do they trigger any pipelines?
